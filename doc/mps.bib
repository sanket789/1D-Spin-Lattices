Most notably, even states obeying a strict area law for the von Neumann entropy are not necessarily approximable by {MPS.} We apply these results to illustrate that quantum computers might outperform classical computers in simulating the time evolution of quantum systems, even for completely translational invariant systems subject to a time independent Hamiltonian.},

	abstract = {This article is an interdisciplinary review of lattice gauge theory and spin systems. It discusses the fundamentals, both physics and formalism, of these related subjects. Spin systems are models of magnetism and phase transitions. Lattice gauge theories are cutoff formulations of gauge theories of strongly interacting particles. Statistical mechanics and field theory are closely related subjects, and the connections between them are developed here by using the transfer matrix. Phase diagrams and critical points of continuous transitions are stressed as the keys to understanding the character and continuum limits of lattice theories. Concepts such as duality, kink condensation, and the existence of a local, relativistic field theory at a critical point of a lattice theory are illustrated in a thorough discussion of the two-dimensional Ising model. Theories with exact local (gauge) symmetries are introduced following Wegner's Ising lattice gauge theory. Its gauge-invariant "loop" correlation function is discussed in detail. Three—dimensional Ising gauge theory is studied thoroughly. The renormalization group of the two dimensional planar model is presented as an illustration of a phase transition driven by the condensation of topological excitations. Parallels are drawn to Abelian lattice gauge theory in four dimensions. {Non-Abelian} gauge theories are introduced and the possibility of quark confinement is discussed. Asymptotic freedom of O(n) Heisenberg spin systems in two dimensions is verified for n≥ and is explained in simple terms. The direction of present-day research is briefly reviewed.},

This counterintuitive idea which has its roots in the nonextensive nature of black-hole entropy serves as a guiding principle in the search for the fundamental laws of Planck-scale physics. In this paper we show that a similar phenomenon emerges from the established laws of classical and quantum physics: the information contained in part of a system in thermal equilibrium obeys an area law. While the maximal information per unit area depends classically only on the number of microscopic degrees of freedom, it may diverge as the inverse temperature in quantum systems. A rigorous relation between area laws and correlations is established and their explicit behavior is revealed for a large class of quantum many-body states beyond equilibrium systems.},

We show that the entire ground state manifold of such models can be found exactly by a tensor network of isometries acting on a space locally isomorphic to the symmetric subspace. Thus, for this wide class of models real-space renormalization can be made exact. Our findings also imply that every such frustration-free spin model satisfies an area law for the entanglement entropy of the ground state, establishing a novel large class of models for which an area law is known. Finally, we show that our approach gives rise to an ansatz class useful for the simulation of almost frustration-free models in a simple fashion, outperforming mean field theory.},
